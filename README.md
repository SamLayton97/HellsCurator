# HellsCurator

Lost in a decrepit manor and hunted by unspeakable monstrosities, you must use your wit to sneak past what is certain death. Find an ancient book and invoke the dark rituals written within to earn your freedom, and if the voices in the halls can be believed, lift a curse. Experiment with accessibility options, including complete support for blind players, in this love letter to classic horror.
